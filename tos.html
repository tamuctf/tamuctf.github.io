		The system is provided “as-is”.  What you see is generally what you get (unless you’re working on a steganography challenge).  Although we do our best to make sure things work as they’re supposed to, occasionally bugs do appear.  We appreciate you letting us know about those pesky bugs and may reward you with bonus points!<br><br>
		You are expected to use your own wit and cunning to solve each challenge and allow all other players the same opportunity.  Please feel free to seek out information that may help you complete the challenges.  DO NOT share information about the challenges, or your solutions or keys with others.  Don’t try and break or abuse the system.  You should know what we mean by this.  If you have questions or would like to report a bug in the system, please email <a href="mailto:ctf@tamu.edu" style="color: rgba(42,42,160,0.9);" >ctf@tamu.edu</a>.<br><br>
		Finally, if you try and break the system, you may be banned from the competition and any damage you cause may be investigated as an offense against Texas A&M University.
		There will be super sweet prizes for finishing in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place as either a TAMU graduate student, undergrad, or member of the public.  We will notify winners via the contact info they provide and they’ll need to respond by 24 April 2017 at 3pm!<br><br>
		By continuing to participate in this challenge, you agree to hold the University, TAMU Cybersecurity Center, the CSE Department, the development team, and all systems administrators and IT staff harmless for any explicit or implicit damages that result from your participation.  You also agree to abide by the rules outlined herein and acknowledge that violations of the rules may result in point penalties or even getting banned from the competition.<br><br></span></h4>
