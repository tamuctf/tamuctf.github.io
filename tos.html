    <h4>This system is owned and under development by the TAMU cybersecurity center.  We worked hard, and are working hard to provide you with a totally awesome cybersecurity challenge platform.  We want you to use it responsibly and not try to do anything nefarious, mischievous, or illegal with it. The system is provided “as-is”.  What you see is generally what you get (unless you’re working on a steganography challenge).  Although we do our best to make sure things work as they’re supposed to, occasionally bugs do appear.  We appreciate you letting us know about those pesky bugs and may reward you with points! You are expected to use your own wit and cunning to solve each challenge and allow all other players the same opportunity.  Please do seek out information that may help you complete the challenges.  Please do not share information about the challenges with others.  Don’t try and break or abuse the system.  You know we mean by this.  If you have questions or would like to report a bug in the system, please email ctf@tamu.edu.  Finally, if you try and break the system, you may be banned from the competition and any damage you cause may be investigated as an offense against Texas A&M University. By continuing to participate in this challenge, you agree to hold the University, TAMU Cybersecurity Center, the CSE Department, the development team, and all systems administrators and IT staff harmless for any explicit or implicit damages that result from your participation.  You also agree to abide by the rules outlined herein and acknowledge that violations of the rules may result in point penalties or even getting banned from the competition.</h4>

We make every effort to ensure the security of this information but make no explicit guarantees.
